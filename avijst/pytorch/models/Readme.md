Tensorflow implementation of the topic models mentioned in the paper.

#### Our implementation of VAEs follows the scikit style. You should check out [Jan Hendrik Metzen](https://jmetzen.github.io/2015-11-27/vae.html) blog entry about this. A very clean and straighforward way to implement VAEs in scikit-style.
